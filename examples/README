These scripts are to provide an idea of how to use the GMES 
package. You can find a simple description of the model in the 
beginning of each script. Be aware that some examples consumes a 
lot of memory if it is executed on a single process.

The run time specified at this file is measured on 2.53 GHz Intel 
Core i3 with Ubuntu 12.04 LTS 64 bit. All scripts are executed on 
a single process. The display function was commented out during 
measurement of the execution time.

To run the examples enter 

$ python <example file name>

air2d.py

Models two-dimensional TMz cylindrical-wave propagation in air.

This script models two-dimensional TMz cylindrical-wave 
propagation in air. A single Ez component located at the center of
the space oscillates sinusoidally. A simple on-time visualization 
display will show the Ez, Hx, and Hy fields of the outgoing wave 
distributed within the grid. You can compare the spatial-symmetry 
properties of these fields with respect to the center of the space
where the excitation is applied.

Approximate run time: 25s

fresnel_reflection.py

Transmittance and reflectance through a thin gold layer.

This script is to obtain the transmittance and reflectance of 
TE polarized light through a thin gold layer.

Approximate run time: 4m30s

mam.py

Shows a man-shaped structure.

This script shows how to set up a geometrical structure in the 
calculation domain. You can see a man-shaped structure in three-
dimensional space constructed using the script.

metal_array.py

A plasmon waveguide consisting of six silver nanospheres in the
air.

This script models a plasmon waveguide consisting of six silver 
nanospheres in the air. A dipole source oscillating along the array
is used for field excitation. A simple on-time visualization 
display will show the Ey fields of the propagating longitudinal
mode. This script was set to use the parallel environment when it 
is executed using a MPI-enabled Python interpreter, like 
'python-mpi' in the mpi4py package. This script requires about 1.1
GB of memory.

Approximate run time: 1h43m6s

phc_slab.py

Simulate a photonic crystal slab waveguide.

The photonic crystal slab consists of a silicon-on-insulator 
substrate with a triangular array of holes. The whole waveguide is
in the air. This structure is presented at 

'N. Moll and G.-L. Bona, "Comparison of three-dimensional photonic
crystal slab waveguides with two-dimensional photonic crystal 
waveguides: Efficient butt coupling into these photonic crystal 
waveguides," J. Appl. Phys., vol. 93, no. 9, pp. 4986-4991, 2003.'

This script requires about 1.3GB of memory.

Approximate run time: 1h37m48s
